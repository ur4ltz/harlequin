Dark, high contrast, warm colorscheme for gvim and 256 color terminal inspired by [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai) and [badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf).

You can also get it from vim.org [here](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4195).

### properties ###

- dark background, warm colors, high contrast, but nothing too garish
- everything that's constantly on screen and not code is low key
- no color clashes, where very different colors are close to each other
